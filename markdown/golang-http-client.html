# Recommended settings for golang http.Client.

I have been reading a few posts about the golang http.Client, and [this]<https://medium.com/@nate510/don-t-use-go-s-default-http-client-4804cb19f779> post suggested that you not use the default http client. 

After learning that I shouldn't the default golang client, my next question was, what settings should I use for the client? I decided to do some research. 

## Timeout

The conclusion is that there is no 'best practice'. The most important thing is to have a timeout value. I would probably set a timeout of 10 seconds and then increase it as needed for requests that I know can take a really long time.

Things to consider:

* Reliabliity of the service (is it frequently slow or bogged down)
* Impact of hanging on the request for logn periods of time. 
* How long to most requests take, and what is the likelihood that a request will exceed your timeout.

Choose a value and adjust it as needed.
