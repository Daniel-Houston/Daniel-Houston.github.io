<h1>Recommended settings for golang http.Client.</h1>
<p>I have been reading a few posts about the golang http.Client, and [this]<a href="https://medium.com/@nate510/don-t-use-go-s-default-http-client-4804cb19f779">https://medium.com/@nate510/don-t-use-go-s-default-http-client-4804cb19f779</a> post suggested that you not use the default http client.</p>
<p>After learning that I shouldn't the default golang client, my next question was, what settings should I use for the client? I decided to do some research.</p>
<h2>Timeout</h2>

https://github.com/axios/axios</p>
<p>The conclusion is that there is no 'best practice'. The most important thing is to have a timeout value. I would probably set a timeout of 10 seconds and then increase it as needed for requests that I know can take a really long time.</p>
<p>Things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliabliity of the service (is it frequently slow or bogged down)</li>
<li>Impact of hanging on the request for logn periods of time.</li>
<li>How long to most requests take, and what is the likelihood that a request will exceed your timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose a value and adjust it as needed.</p>
